# SSC-Case-Study-Winning-Solution

This project is about SSC 2020 Case study competition for students in Canada. The goal was to predict the number of reviews in iTunes podcast.
Our team mainly focused on feature engineering for text data and high-dimensional categorical features. The data is longitudinal structure.
We are chosen top 2 teams, and this is our solution. The code file that I uploaded is the part of my job in our team project.
